__FIRST__: Watch the video on how to set up, configure, and debug Visual Studio Code for Python [here](https://youtu.be/QGn44NvNrvA). The video is 10 minutes long, but installing and configuring will take longer.

This walkthrough will teach you how to clone projects from Github, write your program, and pass-off using Github Classrooms. The video is 16 minutes long, but coding and passing off your code will take longer.
