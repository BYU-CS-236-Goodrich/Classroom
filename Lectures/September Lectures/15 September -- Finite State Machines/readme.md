# 15 September -- Finite State Machines


## Before Class Reading

- Definition 1 and Examples 1-7 from Section 13.2.2
- Skip Definition 2 from Section 13.2.2
- Mealy or Moore machines from the last two paragraphs of Section 13.2.2

## In-Class Discussion

- Generators and recognizers
- Regular expressions generate languages
- Machines interpret or recognize strings in a language
- Two "flavors" of state machines
  - Finite state machines -- they have outputs
  - Finite state automata -- they only accept or reject
- Representing FSMs: tables or pictures
- Using finite state machines/automata in project 1
- What is a lexer?
- How to use FSMs to lex?
