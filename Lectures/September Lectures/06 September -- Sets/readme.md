| 2.1.1  after example 4 | Set-builder notation      | 5               | \| is read "such that" |
| 2.1.1  after example 6 | Empty set                 |                 | ∅ and {} both mean "empty set"                      |

| 2.1.6                  | 7-9                       | 16-21           | ∧ means "and"                                       |

| 2.2.1                  | 4-5                       | 6-9             | set difference "-" is sometimes written as "\\"     |


Bit-wise notation means using binary numbers to represent the elements of a set; see the textbook. For example, suppose that we have a set X taken from a domain, call it U, (sometimes called the universe of discourse in the context of relational algebra.) Consider U={q,w,e,r,t,u,i,o,p} as in the homework. We can represent X using a binary number that assigns a 1 to the ith element of the binary number if the element is in X and 0 otherwise. 

For example, suppose that X={q,p}. Then the bit-wise representation of X is the binary number 100000001. Suppose, as another example, that X={t}. The bit-wise representation for X is the binary number 00001000.
