# 13 November -- Transitive Closure

## Topics

- Paths in directed graphs
- Transitive closure definition
- Transitive closure algorithm

## Reading

- Sections 3.1 and 3.2 from <a href= "CS_236__Transitive_Closures_hehe.pdf"> Closures Tutorial</a>
  - You can combine reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closures
  - If asked to compute a reflexive transitive closure, first do a reflexive closure and then a transitive closure

## Viewing

- A lot of students like to watch the 3Blue1Brown videos about linear algebra to help them with matrix multiplication ideas.
  - Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs"> link to the first chapter</a>.
  - The first three chapters are helpful for understanding the transitive closure algorithm.
