# 10 November -- Graph Definitions and Representations


## Topics

- Directed vs Undirected
- Tuple definition:
  -  G = (V, E) 
  -  V  is the set of all vertices
  -  E  is the set of all edges
  - A directed edge from vertex u to vertex v is written as (u,v)
  - An undirected edge between vertex  u  and vertex  v  is written as {u,v}
- Simple graph (no multiple same edges or self-loops)
- Adjacent and Incident
- Degree: directed vs undirected
- Weighted graph
- Paths
  - Definition
  - Path relation
  - Reachable
- Strongly and weakly connected
- Road not traveled:
  - Multigraphs
  - Bipartite graph
- Graph representations: sets, adjacency list, adjacency matrix
- Adjacency matrix and adjacency list

## Reading

- Section 10.1 definitions 1-2
- Section 10.1.1 (look at a couple of the examples)
- Section 10.2.2 definitions 1-4 and examples 1-4
- Section 10.2.3 examples 5-8
- Section 10.4.2 first paragraph (definition of path)
- Section 10.4.2 definition 2 (circuit/cycle, simple path, simple cycle)
- Section 10.4.3 definition 3 (connected graph -- applies to undirected graph)
- Section 10.4.5 definitions 4 and 5 (strongly connected and weakly connected graph -- applies to directed graph)
- Section 10.4 homework just before problem 16 (definition of reachable)
- Minimum path (not in textbook): a minimum path from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \) is a path from \( u \) to \( v \) that has the fewest edges possible
- Weighted graph (buried in the textbook): a graph whose edges are assigned numbers. Think of the numbers as representing distances, times, connection strengths
- Path relation (not in textbook): the set of ordered pairs \( (a,b) \) where
  - \( a \) and \( b \) are both vertices of \( G \), and
  - there is a path from vertex \( a \) to vertex \( b \) in \( G \)
- Adjacency Lists: Section 10.3.2 examples 1-2 and tables 1-2
- Adjacency Matrices: Section 10.3.3 examples 3-5
