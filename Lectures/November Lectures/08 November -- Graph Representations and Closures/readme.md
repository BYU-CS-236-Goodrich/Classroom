## Topics

- Representations revisited
  - Sets
  - Matrices
  - Graphs
- Digraph representation
    - Reflexive/Irreflexive
    - Symmetric/Asymmetric/Antisymmetric
    - Transitive
- What's a closure

## Reading

- Section 9.3.3 definition 1 and examples 7-10
- Section 9.4.1
- Section 9.1.4 definition 5 and examples 13-15
- Section 9.4.2 entire section including definition 1 and examples 1 and 2. (Definitions of reflexive closure and symmetric closure are embedded in the reading, so you'll need to read the entire section.)
- Sections 1 and 2 from <a href="CS_236_Transitive_Closures.pdf"> Closures Tutorial</a>
