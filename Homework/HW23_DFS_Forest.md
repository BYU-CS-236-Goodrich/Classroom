# HW23_DFS_Forest

For the graph below, perform a depth first search to create a depth first search forest. Begin with vertex A. Whenever there is a choice of which vertex to visit next, choose the vertex that comes alphabetically first.

1. Draw the forest produced using the DFS traversal. Use solid arrows for tree edges.
2. Add all other edges from the graph to the tree, but make those edges dashed.
3. Add postorder numbers as subscripts to each vertex name.
4. Give the reversed list of postorder numbers, that is, reverse the answer from part 3.
