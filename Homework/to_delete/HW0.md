# HW0
---
Slack is one of the main ways we'll be communicating this semester. Slack is available for use in a regular web browser, as well as a mobile or desktop application.

1. The first part of the assignment is to sign in to the class slack workspace (link is available in the announcements in learning suite) and post something fun in the #random channel! Use the @ sign to tag a TA (the TAs will have "(TA)" at the end of their name). Alternatively, you could send a direct message to one of the TAs. Also feel free to start asking questions about how to get set up for the class
2.  When you have familiarized yourself with the slack, send a direct message to a TA on slack to get full credit for the assignment. The message must contain the following text

```
I understand the following to be true:
1. The only accepted formats for HW and Exam submission are .pdf and .png any other format may not be accepted. 
2. Any HW's submitted must be oriented correctly 
```

3.  Make sure to use your full name as it appears on learning suite. It makes it easier to find you!

If you added the course after the add/drop deadline please reach out to a TA on slack!
