# HW09b_Propositional_Logic

### Question 1

Construct the truth table for each of the following expressions. Indicate for each expression which of the following fits:

- tautology (Always true)
- contradiction (cannot be true)
- contingent (meaning that it is neither a tautology or a contradiction)

a.

$$(P \land (P \rightarrow Q)) \land \lnot Q$$

b.

$$(P \rightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow (\lnot P \lor Q)$$

c.

$$(Q \land (P \rightarrow Q)) \rightarrow P$$

---

### Question 2

Prove that the following expression $$Q \lor \lnot ((P \rightarrow Q) \land P)$$ is true. In other words, use logical equivalences from section 1.3.2 in the textbook to prove that the expression can be reduced to $T$.
