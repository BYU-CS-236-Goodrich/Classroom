# HW19_Closures

1. Give the following closures, as specified:

a. Let R be the relation \{(a, b), (b, c), (c, c)\} on \{a, b, c\}. Give the reflexive closure as a graph.

b. Let R be the relation \{(a, b), (a, c), (b, a), (c, b), (c, c)\} on \{a, b, c\}. Give the symmetric closure as a matrix.

c. Let R be the relation \{(a, a), (a, b), (c, d), (d, a)\} on \{a, b, c, d\}. Give the transitive closure as a set of ordered pairs.

d. Let R be the relation \{(a, d), (a, b), (c, d), (d, a)\} on \{a, b, c, d, e\}. Give the reflexive-transitive closure as a matrix.
