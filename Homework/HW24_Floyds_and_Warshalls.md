# HW24_Floyds_and_Warshalls

### Question 1

Assuming Warshall's algorithm uses vertex 1 for its first pivot and vertex 2 for its second pivot, give the adjacency matrix after the first two iterations of the algorithm. In other words, give the adjacency matrix after using both vertex 1 as a pivot and vertex 2 as a pivot.

### Question 2

Assuming Floyd's algorithm uses vertex 1 for its first pivot and vertex 2 as its second pivot, give the adjacency matrix after the first two iterations of the algorithm. In other words, give the adjacency matrix after using both vertex 1 as a pivot and vertex 2 as a pivot.

### Question 3

Recall that if we need to run Floyd's algorithm on an undirected graph, we simply replace each undirected edge with two directed edges, on in each direction, and then run Floyd's algorithm as usual.

a) For the graph below, give the initial adjacency matrix so that Floyd's algorithm can be run on it.

b)Then, assuming Floyd's algorithm uses vertex 1 for its first pivot, give the adjacency matrix after the first iteration.
