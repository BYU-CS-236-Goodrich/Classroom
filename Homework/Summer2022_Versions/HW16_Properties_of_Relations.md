### Question 1
Consider the following relations that are all relations on A (i.e. $A \leftrightarrow A$) where A = {a, b, c, d}. 

Indicate which of the following properties each relation has
- Reflexive
- Irreflexive
- Asymmetric
- Antisymmetric
- Symmetric
- Transitive

(Hint: You may consider drawing the graph or the matrix representation to help in identifying the properties)

a. \{(a,a), (a,b),(d,c)\}

b. \{(a,d), (d,a)\}

c. \{(a,d),(a,b),(c,c)\}

d. \{(a,d), (a,b), (c,c)\}

e. \{\}

f. \{(a,c),(c,a),(c,c),(a,a)\}
