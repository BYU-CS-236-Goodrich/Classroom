# HW11_Predicate_Logic_and_Resolution

### Question 1

Given the following premises, use resolution and universal instantiation to prove F(c) where c is part of the domain of x and w.

> 1. $\forall x A (x)$
> 2. $\forall x [\lnot A (x) \lor C (x)]$
> 3. $\forall x,w [\lnot C (x) \lor F (w)]$

### Question 2

Let the domain of the variables x, y, and w be the set {a,b,c}. Given the following premises, use resolution, universal generalization (Table 2 in section 1.6.7), and universal instantiation to prove $\forall x B(x)$ 

> 1. $\lnot A(x) \lor B(y)$
> 2. $\lnot C(x) \lor G(w)$
> 3. $\lnot G(x)$
> 4. $A(x)$

---
### Question 3

Repeat problem 2, but prove $\forall w  [\lnot C(w)]$

> 1. $\lnot A(x) \lor B(y)$
> 2. $\lnot C(x) \lor G(w)$
> 3. $\lnot G(x)$
> 4. $A(x)$

*Note that "Universal Generalization" is used when you need to turn an arbitrary w into an arbitrary x (when neither variable is specified, it is arbitrary and must hold for all values it can take on).*
