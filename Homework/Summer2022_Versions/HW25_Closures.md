# HW25_Closures

### Question 1
Give the following closures, as specified:

a. Let R be the relation \{(a, b), (b, c), (c, c)\} on \{a, b, c\}. Give the reflexive closure as a graph. 


b. Let R be the relation \{(a, b), (a, c), (b, a), (c, b), (c, c)\} on \{a, b, c\}. Give the symmetric closure as a matrix. 

c. Let R be the relation \{(a, a), (a, b), (c, d), (d, a)\} on \{a, b, c, d\}. Give the transitive closure as a set of ordered pairs. 

d. Let R be the relation \{(a, d), (a, b), (c, d), (d, a)\} on \{a, b, c, d, e\}. Give the reflexive-transitive closure as a matrix.

### Question 2

For each of the following relations:

i. state whether the relation is an equivalence relation and 

ii. if it is an equivalence relation then list the equivalence classes of its corresponding partition (as a set of sets), and if it is not then list all of the properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) it violates. 

In all cases, the relations are on the set 

A: A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. 


a. {(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)} 

b. A x A 

c. {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 3), (4, 4)} 

d. ({2, 3} x A) U {(1, 1), (4, 4)}
