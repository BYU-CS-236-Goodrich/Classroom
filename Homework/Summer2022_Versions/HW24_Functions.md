### Question 1
Classify each of the following as a total function, a partial function, or not a function. 

a. f = \{(1, a)\} for domain space \{1\} and range space \{a, b\}. 

b. f(x) = 1/x when both domain and range space are the Real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$). 

c. f(x) = sin(x) when domain space is the Natural numbers ($\mathbb{N}$, the positive integers) and range space is $\mathbb{R}$. 

d. f(x) = $x^{½}$ when both domain and range space are R. (Recall that the square root of a positive number n is n.) 

e. f(x, y) = max(x, y) for domain space $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}$ and range space Real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$). (The `max()` function returns the item with the highest value)

f. f = \{((1, 1), a), ((2, 1), b), ((1, 2), b)\} for domain space \{1, 2\}, \{1, 2\} and range space \{a, b\}. 

g. f = \{((1, 1), a), ((1, 1), b), ((1, 2), b)\} for domain space \{1\}, \{1, 2\} and range space \{a, b\}.

### Question 2

Classify each of the following functions as: injection, surjection, bijection, or none. Give the most specific answer. 

a. f =\{(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 2), (d, 3)\} for domain space \{a, b, c, d\} and range space \{1, 2, 3, 4\} 

b. f =\{(a, 1), (b, 2), (d, 3), (c, 5)\} for domain space \{a, b, c, d\} and range space \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} 

c. f =\{(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 4), (d, 3)\} for domain space \{a, b, c, d\} and range space \{1, 2, 3, 4\} 

d. f =\{(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 4), (d, 3), (e, 1)\} for domain space \{a, b, c, d, e\} and range space \{1, 2, 3, 4\} 

e. f(x) = cos(x) when both domain and range space are $\mathbb{R}$. 

f. f(x) = 3x+2 when both domain and range space are $\mathbb{R}$. 

g. f(x) = $x^2+1$ when both domain and range space are positive reals $(\mathbb{R}^{+})$.
