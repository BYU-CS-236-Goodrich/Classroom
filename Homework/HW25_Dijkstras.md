# HW25_Dijkstras

Consider the following weighted graph G.

![](/Homework/images/HW24_Graph_G.png)

Use Dijkstra's algorithm as discussed in textbook with the special (starting) vertex a to answer the following questions. After initialization, this is what the distinguished set looks like, S={}
and this is what the set of vertex labels looks like

| vertex | L(v) |
| ------ | ---- |
| a      | 0    |
| b      | ∞    |
| c      | ∞    |
| d      | ∞    |
| e      | ∞    |

### Question 1

What does the set of distinguished vertices S and the list of vertex labels L(v) look like after the first iteration of the algorithm?

---

### Question 2

What does the set of distinguished vertices S and the list of vertex labels L(v) look like after the second iteration of the algorithm?

---

### Question 3

What does the set of distinguished vertices S and the list of vertex labels L(v) look like after the algorithm completes?
